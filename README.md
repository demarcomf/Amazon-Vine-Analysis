## Summary

Positivity bias existed in the small sample taken within the Vine program, almost non-existent compared to the totals of the non-vine program. Not even sure why we're comparing these two. Verified purchases needs to be a standard metric in any e-commerce enviroment. Too many companies make fake positive reviews for their own offerings and potentially create false negatives for their competition. Without this key indicator, the results here are almost irrelevant.
